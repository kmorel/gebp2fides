# GE Fides Metadata Creator

This script is designed to take ADIOS2 bp files that have been generated by GE
simulations like Genesis and creates an associated .json file containing the
Fides metadata necessary to load the data into programs like ParaView. The
script will automatically find all the fields in the file and register them in
the Fides metadata. Because all fields are included, it is recommended to
subselect only the fields needed when loading into ParaView.

## Usage

To generate Fides metadata, run the `gebp2fides` script. For simplicity, add the
directory containing this script to your path.

Use the `-h` or `--help` option to get details on the command line interface and
options supported.

```bash
gebp2fides -h
```

The basic interface is to first give the input `.bp` filename and (optionally)
the output `.json` filename.

```bash
gebp2fides sol/sol_2896000.bp sol_2896000.fides.json
```

If the output file is not given, a file with the same name as the input with the
`.bp` extension replaced with `.fides.json` will be used.
